## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers                          | Non-Computable Numbers                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4            | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e                           |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3             | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3                         |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.
